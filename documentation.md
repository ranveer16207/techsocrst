##  Conceptual Learning

### **New Concepts I Discovered**
- **[Concept Name]:** [ascii table, used it for pre-assigned specific number.]
- **[Another Concept]:** [getline, to get the whole text without skipping the remaining sentence after space.]

### **How I Applied These Concepts**
[i used ascii tables pre assigned values and made sure that even after the shift the total sum of the new number still lies in between guven range of numbers.]

### **Real-World Connections**
[it can be used to send a message with specific shift and thus message can go on without getting read by unwanted person.]
